Exercise 1
  Add more details to stats method so it prints the state of two arrays.

Exercise 2
  Improve program the following way. Each cell in array must represent the percentage of life of a robot from 1 to 100. Initial value should be 100. Each attack should take random number from robotâ€™s life value. This random number should be from 30 to 100. If life number is zero or less, we should consider this robot destroyed.
